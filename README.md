# Bike Sales Analysis using Excel
This repository includes an Excel file containing the analysis of bike sales using a dataset provided by Alex The Analyst. I did some data cleaning and created a dashboard in Excel. 

## Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Removed duplicates by clicking the 'Remove Duplicates' in the Data tab of Excel.
- Re-formated values for the Income column
- Made abbreviations clear for Martial Status and Gender columns. The gender column had values like 'M' and 'F'; I replaced them with 'Male' and 'Female'. Marital Status had values of 'S' and 'M' and were replaced with ' Single' and 'Married'. 
- Added an age brackets column obtained from the Age column using the IF function, where I grouped ages: Adolescent (< 31), Middle Age (31â€“54), and Old (> 54). By using age brackets it makes it easier to categorize; as a result, this facilitates analyzing and interpreting the data.
  * ```
    =IF(L2 > 54,"Old",IF(L2 >= 31,"Middle Age",IF(L2 < 31,"Adolescent","Invalid")))
    ```
